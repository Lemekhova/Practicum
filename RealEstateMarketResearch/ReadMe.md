## Findings
The project analyzed the provided data on apartment sales in Saint Petersburg. Among other insights, the following patterns were identified:

- The average time to sell an apartment is six months. A sale can be considered slow if the listing is active for more than 8 months.
- An apartment is considered central if it is located within an 8-10 km radius of the city center.
- Most central apartments have ceilings 3 meters high, whereas the regional average is 2.5 meters.
- Apartments on the first floor are cheaper than on any other floor, and top-floor apartments are the most expensive. However, in the city center, the first floor is significantly cheaper, while the price difference for top floors and other floors is smaller compared to the overall data.
- One- and two-room apartments dominate the market, but in the city center, two- and three-room apartments are more common.
